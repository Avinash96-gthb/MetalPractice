# 30 Days of Metal — Practice Project

This repository is my personal practice space for learning and experimenting with [Metal](https://developer.apple.com/metal/), Apple's low-level graphics and compute framework for macOS, iOS, and iPadOS.  
I’m following along with the **"Thirty Days of Metal"** tutorial series and adapting the examples into my own code.

## 📚 Learning Resource

This project is based on the **Thirty Days of Metal** tutorial by [Warren Moore](https://github.com/warrenm), available here:
